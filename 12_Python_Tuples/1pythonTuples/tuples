Tuple Items

Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
Ordered

When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
Unchangeable

Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
Allow Duplicates

Since tuple are indexed, tuples can have items with the same value:


Python Collections (Arrays)

There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

    List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
    Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
    Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
    Dictionary is a collection which is unordered and changeable. No duplicate members.

When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.
